### Glock 19 (pistol)
A reliable sidearm that offers a balance of accuracy and firepower. Use it to dispatch zombies from a distance or as a backup when ammunition for heavier weapons runs low.

### Remington 870 (shotgun)
When the undead close in, the Remington 870 shotgun becomes your best friend. Its wide spread and high impact make it ideal for clearing out groups of zombies in one powerful blast.

### M16 (assault rifle)
The M16 assault rifle is a versatile weapon that excels in medium-range combat. With its semi-automatic and fully automatic capabilities, it provides precision and rapid firepower to thin out the zombie hordes.
